2. Getting Here
Your journey usually begins in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan.

International Arrival: Fly into Islamabad International Airport (ISB). We recommend arriving 1-2 days before your tour starts to rest and handle any logistical delays.

Travel to Skardu/Gilgit:

By Air: The most convenient route is a 1-hour scenic flight from Islamabad to Skardu or Gilgit. This flight offers breathtaking views of Nanga Parbat and the Karakoram range. Note: Flights are weather-dependent.

By Road: If flights are cancelled, we travel via the legendary Karakoram Highway (KKH). This is an adventure in itself, following the Indus River through Kohistan and Chilas.

3. Best Time to Visit
The ideal time depends on the adventure you seek:

Summer (June – August): The prime season for high-altitude trekking (K2 Base Camp, Gondogoro La) and mountaineering. The passes are open, and the weather is generally stable.

Spring (April – May) & Autumn (September – October): Perfect for cultural tours, sightseeing in Hunza/Skardu valleys, and lower-altitude hikes. The cherry blossoms in spring and golden foliage in autumn are spectacular.

Winter (December – March): For specialized expeditions, such as Snow Leopard tracking or winter survival treks.

4. Health & Altitude
Acclimatization: Skardu is located at approx. 2,228m (7,310ft). Our itineraries are designed with gradual ascent to prevent Altitude Sickness (AMS).

Fitness: Please ensure you are physically fit for your chosen activity. For technical treks, cardiovascular endurance is key.

Insurance: Mandatory for trekkers. You must have travel insurance that covers medical evacuation (helicopter rescue) up to 6,000m (or the max altitude of your trek).

5. Packing Essentials
While we provide camping equipment (tents, mats) for treks, you should bring personal gear including:

Layering System: Base layers, insulating fleece, and a waterproof/windproof outer shell.

Footwear: Broken-in trekking boots with good ankle support.

Sun Protection: High SPF sunscreen, lip balm, sunglasses, and a sun hat (UV radiation is high at altitude).

Hydration: Reusable water bottles or hydration bladders.

Personal Meds: A basic first aid kit and any personal prescription medications.

6. Money & Connectivity
Currency: The currency is the Pakistani Rupee (PKR).

Cash is King: While major cities like Islamabad have ATMs, they can be unreliable in remote mountainous regions. We recommend carrying sufficient cash for personal expenses, souvenirs, and tips.

Connectivity: International roaming often does not work in Gilgit-Baltistan. The local network provider is SCOM. We can assist you in purchasing a local SIM card upon arrival in Skardu for 4G connectivity in major towns.

7. Cultural Etiquette
The people of Gilgit-Baltistan are renowned for their hospitality.

Dress Code: We recommend modest clothing. For men and women, covering shoulders and knees is respectful to local customs.

Photography: Always ask for permission before taking photos of locals, especially women.

Respect: The mountains are sacred to many; please follow "Leave No Trace" principles to keep our environment pristine.
