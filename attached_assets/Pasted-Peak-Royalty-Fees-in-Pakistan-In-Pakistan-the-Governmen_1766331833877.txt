Peak Royalty Fees in Pakistan
In Pakistan, the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the Ministry of Tourism require all climbing expeditions attempting peaks above 6,500 meters to pay a royalty fee. These fees are vital for the conservation of our mountain ranges, the maintenance of trekking routes, and the economic support of local communities.

At North Karakoram, we believe in complete transparency. While these government fees are typically included in our full-service expedition packages, understanding the regulatory structure helps you better plan your adventure.

Royalty Rates (2024-2025)
Royalty fees are strictly determined by the altitude of the peak and the season of the climb. To encourage off-season climbing, the government frequently offers significant discounts for winter and autumn expeditions compared to the standard summer season.

(Note: Official rates change periodically. Please contact us for the latest official fee structure for your team size and target peak.)

1. The 8,000m Giants
This category includes the most prestigious peaks on Earth: K2, Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, and the Gasherbrums.

Standard Season (Summer): Full royalty rates apply.

Discounted Season (Winter/Autumn): Substantial reductions are often available.

Team Size: Fees cover a standard team size (up to 7 members). Teams exceeding 7 members are subject to additional per-person charges.

2. 7,000m to 7,500m Peaks
Includes technical giants like Gasherbrum IV, Masherbrum, Rakaposhi, and Spantik.

Fees for these peaks are tiered based on exact altitude.

Significant discounts are applied for climbs attempted outside the peak summer window.

3. 6,500m to 7,000m Peaks
Includes challenging peaks like K7 and summits in the Trango Towers group.

These peaks generally have a lower royalty fee structure compared to the 8,000m giants, making them attractive objectives for technical alpine teams.

4. Peaks Below 6,500m (Royalty Free)
To promote tourism and alpine climbing, the Government of Pakistan currently waives royalty fees for peaks below 6,500 meters.

Why this matters: This makes objectives like Pastore Peak (6,209m), Mingling Sar (6,050m), and Laila Peak (6,096m) incredibly cost-effective options for climbers looking for high-altitude experience without the high permit costs.

Essential Regulations
Liaison Officer (LO): For all peaks above 6,500m (or any peak within a restricted zone), the team must be accompanied by a Liaison Officer. The expedition team is responsible for the LO's equipment, food, transport, and daily allowance.

Environmental Fee: A non-refundable environmental fee is mandatory for all expeditions to contribute toward waste management and conservation efforts in the region.

Briefing & De-Briefing: Every expedition must attend a mandatory briefing at the Alpine Club of Pakistan in Islamabad before the trip and a de-briefing upon return. North Karakoram manages this entire process for our clients.

Search & Rescue: A deposit or guarantee for helicopter rescue is mandatory before the permit is issued.
